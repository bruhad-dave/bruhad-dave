Hello world, I'm Bruhad Dave. 

I'm really interested in learning the ropes of computer science and programming to apply to infectious disease research. I have experience working with genomic & transcriptomic data (NGS) and long-read sequencing data, and I've used Python, R and Bash (and a SLURM-based HPC system -- PARAM Brahma @IISER, Pune) over the course of my research. My current research focusses on the malaria-causing pathogen, _Plasmodium falciparum_, which I'm studying under the supervision of Dr. Krishanpal Karmodiya at IISER, Pune. 

Some things I'm interested in and want to pursue include:
- Infectious diseases, immunology & epidemiology
- Therapeutics, prophylactics research _in silico_ 
- Omics and systems & computational biology
- The development of widely accessible computational tools for biology research
- Science communication, education, policy
- Speculative fiction
