**`@Work==True`**

My interests lie at the intersection of evolutionary biology and infectious diseases & emerging pathogens using genomics and computational biology tools.

So far, I have had the opportunity to explore RNA "mutations" in *Plasmodium falciparum*[^1] for my MS thesis, with Dr Krishanpal Karmodiya. I have also worked on shorter projects in a neurobiology lab -- where I attempted to find correlations between head posture and song in zebrafinches -- and a biochemistry lab (where I learned to make multilamellar lipid vesicles, and examined the vesicle-forming properties of lipid combinations). 

At the moment, I am working with Dr Nishad Matange on analysing whole-genome sequencing data from lab-evolved drug-resistant *E. coli* cultures. I am also brushing up on my programming skills -- both in general and in the bioinformatics context -- by trying to compose exisiting and custom tools into coherent analytical workflows (part of my motivation for this comes from the fact that the installation process of many bioinformatics tools is so inconducive to inner peace).

I :heart: Python and Bash (though I've still got lots to learn in both!); I am not as familiar with R (but I can make do); I plan on learning Julialang next!

**`@Work!=True`**

I enjoy reading speculative fiction broadly defined (science-fiction, fantasy, et al.); I also write in this genre[^2]<sup>,</sup>[^3]; I'm hoping to read all of the sff classics I haven't yet gotten to, some time soon! I also enjoy endlessly orgnizing things, constantly making lists of things to read/watch/listen to later, curating playlists, and running. 

**`if "--help":`**

I frequently write, and sometimes also speak, parenthetically and with em dashes ðŸ™‚.
