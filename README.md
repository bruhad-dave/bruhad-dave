<h1 align="center">Hello, World! :wave:</h1>

I am a developer and bioinformatician mostly motivated by curiosity and the problem-solving high! 

Currently a Sr. Bioinformatician at the [Genomic Surveillance Unit](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/collaboration/genomic-surveillance-unit-gsu/) based at the [Wellcome Sanger Institute](https://www.sanger.ac.uk), my work focuses on data analysis and pipeline development in the context of genomic surveillance and pathogen genomics. Prior to my current role, I was a research intern at EMBL-EBI, working with Dr John Lees and contributing to a [python package](https://github.com/bacpop/pp-netlib) that handles graph utilities for [PopPUNK](https://github.com/bacpop/PopPUNK). I also initiated exploratory analysis on [pneumococcal genomic variation patterns](https://www.bacpop.org/blog/mutspect/). My experience involves working with a range of bioinformatics data types and applications; some highlights include my work with _P. falciparum_ [see paper here](https://doi.org/10.1093/nargab/lqac036), exploring the genomes of lab-evolved drug resistant _E. coli_, and identifying bacteria in clinical samples from nosocomial infections. 

My experience and interests also include writing - everything from [sci-fi/fantasy short fiction](https://bruhaddave.wordpress.com/tag/fiction/) to [popular science writing](https://iiserpunenews.wordpress.com/2019/04/16/this-soup-had-prebiotic-croutons/) to technical writing/code documentation [example](https://github.com/genomic-surveillance/AmpRecon) - and editing. You could say my two main passions are solving interesting problems and working with compelling stories!
