<h1 align="center">Hello, World!:wave:</h1>

**`@Work==True`**

I am a bioinformatician and budding (biological) software developer interested in working on problems in human health and disease. My research interests include applying pespectives from functional genomics and evolutionary biology to areas such as infectious disease research, host-pathogen interactions & coevolution, human genetic disorders and cancer genomics. 

I was most recently a research intern at EMBL-EBI, working with Dr John Lees and contributing to a [python package](https://github.com/bacpop/pp-netlib) that handles graph utilities for [PopPUNK](https://github.com/bacpop/PopPUNK). I also contributed to the initial exploratory analysis of patterns of [pneumococcal genomic variation](https://www.bacpop.org/blog/mutspect/).  

Previously, as a project assistant at IISER, Pune, I worked with Dr Nishad Matange's lab, analyzing DNA sequencing data from lab-evolved drug-resistant *E. coli* lines, as well as performing some exploratory analysis on data from nosocomial bacteria. In 2021, I completed my master's thesis under the supervison of Dr Krishanpal Karmodiya at IISER, Pune, where I examined the landscape of transcriptomic variation in the malaria parasite, *Plasmodium falciparum*[^1]. 

**`@Work!=True`**

I enjoy reading speculative fiction broadly defined (science-fiction, fantasy, et al.); I also write in this genre[^2]<sup>,</sup>[^3]; I'm hoping to get to all of the sff classics I haven't yet read some time soon! I also enjoy endlessly organizing stuff, constantly making lists of things to read/watch/listen to later, curating playlists, and running. 

**`if "--help":`**

I frequently write -- and sometimes also speak -- parenthetically and with em dashes ðŸ™‚.
