<h1 align="center">Hello, World!:wave:</h1>

**`@Work==True`**

I am a bioinformatician and budding (biological) software developer interested in working on problems in human health and disease. My research interests include pathogen genomics & infectious diseases, human genetic disorders, cancer genomics, and evolutionary biology (particularly as it pertains to the aforementioned fields). 

I am currently a research intern at EMBL-EBI, working with Dr John Lees and contributing to the maintenance and development of a couple of pre-existing open-source bioinformatic tools. 

Previously, as a project assistant at IISER, Pune, I worked with Dr Nishad Matange's lab, analysing DNA sequencing data from lab-evolved drug-resistant *E. coli* lines, as well as performing some exploratory analysis on data from nosocomial bacteria. Before that, I completed my master's thesis under the supervison of Dr Krishanpal Karmodiya at IISER, Pune, where I examined the landscape of transcriptomic variation in the malaria parasite, *Plasmodium falciparum*[^1]. 

**`@Work!=True`**

I enjoy reading speculative fiction broadly defined (science-fiction, fantasy, et al.); I also write in this genre[^2]<sup>,</sup>[^3]; I'm hoping to get to all of the sff classics I haven't yet read some time soon! I also enjoy endlessly organizing stuff, constantly making lists of things to read/watch/listen to later, curating playlists, and running. 

**`if "--help":`**

I frequently write -- and sometimes also speak -- parenthetically and with em dashes ðŸ™‚.
